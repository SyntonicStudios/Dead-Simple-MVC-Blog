        <p><strong>Although only the front end (HTML + CSS) are currently up and running, my vision for <a href="http://stockexplorer.net">StockExplorer.net</a> is to be a highly usable, attractive and fun web platform for education about investment. I think that the main draw will be the ability to track stock picks</strong> – so let&rsquo;s elaborate on that first. The ability of a user to have an account on a website and being able to create a portfolio and track it online is not entirely new. Yahoo Finance has been doing it for a while. There you can log in with your user ID, create one or many portfolios filled with equities, bonds and other investment vehicles and have it automatically track your gains and losses over time. Likewise the CNBC website offers an annual stock picking challenge where you are given a certain amount of &ldquo;imaginary money&rdquo; at the beginning of the contest and you compete with other users by using that money to buy, sell or short sell stocks and build up the most valuable portfolio by the end of the contest. </p>

        <p><strong>My concept for investment tracking is similar to these two mechanisms, but I am attempting to add to both the utility and perhaps more importantly, the fun of picking stocks.</strong> I don&rsquo;t want to get too far into the exact features my stock tracking will have before the website is even available, but I will say that I have been influenced by some of the things I have seen elsewhere on the web. For instance, Microsoft&rsquo;s Xbox Live service allows you to post a web image called a &ldquo;Gamer Card&rdquo; that displays the name you go by on the service while playing games, your reputation amongst other users, and a score that reflects the number of in-game achievements you have received. It&rsquo;s a pretty slick way to pull what happens in the world of gameplay out into the real world for all to see. And furthermore, it offers up real, solid proof of what happened in these games. Did you know in my early research for this project that <strong>I did not find a single mechanism for users to actually prove how good or bad their stock picks were</strong>? Granted if the investment choices reflect a real account with real money in it, then there is probably good reason not to show anyone (though even in that situation there may be people that would like to display such a thing to the public), but for contests like the CNBC Million Dollar Challenge or any &ldquo;for fun&rdquo; stock picking utility online – <strong>there is no easy way to unfailingly show to others how good or bad you did. <a href="http://stockexplorer.net">StockExplorer.net</a> will remedy this!</strong><br>
          <br>
        <strong>Another aspect of the stock tracking service that I wanted to expand on was the social networking aspect of it.</strong> In that regard I was inspired by how online fantasy football leagues have evolved. Such services allow a group of people to easily set up, administer and track performance of a fantasy football league for free. The users are given simple yet powerful interfaces for setting up user accounts, running the draft and of course the software automatically tracks the performance of the players that the users have selected as well as the overall standings of the users. But where is the equivalent of this for putting together a stock portfolio? Surely there are people that think they could pick stocks better than their friends, or would at least like to try their hand at it. How about a parent talking about investment to their children and wanting to show them the mechanics of it with a hands-on experience without putting real money at stake? Or how about a service that tracks the picks of all the students in a class that teaches about investment? Services like these do not yet exist, but I think that there is an addressable market for them – and I think that these people will be impressed with the way that the application I am building will meet their needs.</p>
